In this project, I analyzed and explored dataset with SQL using Mysql Server And PowerBi. I wrangled the data to find insights and patterns like which product sold the most and what date.
As the Data Analyst, I was directed by the CMO of Amazing Chocolate company, a fictitious manufacturing company to analyze the sales  data of the company . He wants to keep an eye on the company’s Internal performance 
The company, Amazing Chocaolate, manufactures expensive Chocolate products that could be eaten by adults and childeren and it sells them directly to consumers nationwide as well as several other countries.

## The processes I took in other to provide answers to the above questions are:
* I was provided a CSV sql file which i uploaded direct to MySql server.
* Then I used that same file for powerBi Analyze.
* Cleaned the data using Power Query and merging necessary tables to overcome ambuguity.
* Created relationships; data modeling between the tables via the Diagram View of Power Pivot using many-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
* Wrote few DAX to answer questions 
* Designed my dashboard with the reports and most important metrics.

## Dashboard Report
Here is a PowerBi Dashboard report that i buildt to further visualize the insights and trends derived from this analysis.
